Welcome to the Kaczynski tutorial.
This is the tutorial for the Kaczynski text editor.
This is somewhat similar to the Vim or Emacs tutorials.





In the tutorial, the keybinds are marked with brackets [ ]
Keybinds that require shift to be held are indicated like [S- ]
Keybinds that require control to be held are indicated like [C- ]
Keybinds that require alt/meta to be held are indicated like [A- ]





You can move your cursor with the arrow keys.

This is because Vim's hjkl was chosen back when there were no
separate arrow keys intended for movement, and instead the
arrows were on H J K and L.
If you want, you can rebind it to hjkl in the config later once
implemented, until then please proceed with the tutorial.

You can move to the beginning of the line with [home], and the end
of the line with [end]
You can press [page up] to go one screen up, and [page down] to go
one screen down.

Now move your cursor down until the next section.




















Please read through the following information:

You can save files by pressing [S].
If you want to save the file with a different name, press [S-S].
You can make new files with [S-N].
You can quit Kaczynski by pressing [S-Q].
You can open other files with [S-O].

If you are sure you have read through this part, please
proceed to the next section about WRITE mode.





You can enter WRITE mode with [enter].
In WRITE mode you can write things.
By pressing [escape] you can go back to NORMAL mode.

If you want, you can move to the lines marked with ">",
and you can try to enter WRITE mode and write each of these
sentences as fast as you can.

Proceed to the section about SELECT mode.





Select characters with [V], or select whole lines with [X].

In SELECT mode pressing [S-D], [D], backspace or delete will
delete the selected text.

By pressing [escape] you can go back to NORMAL mode.

Try to select the (((texts))) marked with ">" in and delete it

> Delete (((this text))) right here.
> And (((this))) too.
> (((Delete))) the (((parentheses))) here (((this))) too.
> Now [X] to select this line, move up until the first ">" is
selected, and delete it.

Proceed to the section about MOVE mode.





You can enter MOVE mode by pressing [M] in NORMAL mode.
In MOVE mode you can press up and down to move the current
line up or down.

> Try moving THIS line
> under THIS one.
> but above THIS one.
> Now move THIS line above the previous ones

Proceed to the section about SHELL mode.





You can enter SHELL mode by pressing [$] in NORMAL mode.
In SHELL mode you can type shell commands, then press enter,
which will insert the command's output at your cursor.

Try it by running the "date" command at the ">".
> 
Try it by running the "cat test.txt" command in the line under.





The Kaczynski configuration "unabombrc" file is located in
~/.config/Kaczynski/unabombrc
If you did the installation process, the template one should
already be there.





Currently this is the end of the tutorial.
